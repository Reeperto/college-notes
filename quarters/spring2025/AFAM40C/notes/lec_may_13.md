# Zionism

- Theodore Herzl
    - Proposed in 1897 the idea of a land for a Jewish nation
    - Herzl saw anti-semitism as a growing and eventual threat
    - Rejected by most Jews in Western Europe, even the reformed rabbis
    - Western European Jews often viewed themselves not as a nationality and rather associated with the European countries like France, Germany, etc.

- Herzl gains more support from Eastern europeans

- Palestine was rural and dominated by family elites
    - Younger family members would often receive education abroad
    - The elites controlled the politics of Palestine

- Former mayor of Jerusalem Yusuf Diya sends a letter to Theodor
    - "My god who can deny..." Jews from living in the place they came from
    - This section was plucked out from the overall letter and became a symbol of support of the Zionist plan
    - The letter in its total did not support Theodor's ideas
        - "Palestine is an integral part of the Ottaman empire, and more gravely it is inhabited by others"
        - "In the name of god, let Palestine be left alone"

    - Herzl writes back and does not address Diya's point that Palestine is already inhabitted and thus cannot be turned into a Jewish nation state
        - Herzl focuses on the argument that the immigration of Jewish people would bring with them propserity and wealth
            - Follows a very similar idea to the argument of bringing civility to colonies
        - "It is their well being, their individual wealth, that we will increase by bringing in our own"

- Balfour Declaration (Nov. 1917)
    - After WWI, British offer Palestine to the Zionist's 
    - "Establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish People"
    - Effectively pledged British support of Herzl's plan for control of Palestine as well as the control of immigration of Palestine
    - Overwhelming population of Palestine at the time was Arab, something that goes unmentioned in the declaration
        - Discarded/off handedly reffered to  as "existing non-Jewish communities"
        - Not described as a nation or people
    - 6% of Palestine was Jewish at the time
        - This declaration really was a mandate
