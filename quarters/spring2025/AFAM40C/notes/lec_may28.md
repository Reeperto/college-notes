- New Logics
    - There exists a right to a Jewish ethno-state
    - Zionistic-Israeli Identity:
        - Two classes of citizens: Jewish-Israeli's and everyone else
- New Subjectivities
    - Zionist perspective       => Israel has a right to exist
    - Anti-Colonial perspective => Palestineans have a right to exist and/or freedom

- A state does not have a given right to exist, it establishes its right to exist by force
