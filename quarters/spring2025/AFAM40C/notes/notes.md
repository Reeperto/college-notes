# Catastrophe

- Catastrophe can be two things:
    - An event
    - An everyday force of life (banality of evil)

The catastrophe in this context is the **invention and administration of race**, broken into three points

- Historical policy
- Event and the quotidian
- Memory and representation


## The Littoral
Def: *Of or on a shore*

- The littoral as a symbol/entity of TAST
    - A constellation of power networks that supported the TAST
- Imposed economic changes, but even more so imposed the notion of people being indistinguishable to a commodity ("the magic trick")
    - The littoral was the location/environment in which this could happen

## The Wake

Def:
- The service before a funeral
- To be "awake"
- The currents following a ship
    - Observed long after 

The wake of the TAST:
- Bodies thrown off indiscriminately from ships to drown and rot at the bottom of the ocean
    - Some literally caught and dragged across the ocean by the currents when thrown in
- The effects ("the wake") are felt/continue into the present

## The Zong

- Was original a Dutch ship called the "The Zorg" which means "to care"
- British company purchases it and renames it the "Zong"; Mayor of Liverpool has interests in this company
- Leaves the golden coast with 442 on board, over 2x the capacity
    - Company was in debt after buying the ship and needed to maximize profits
- Leaves on route to Jamaica
    - Did not restock on water
    - Captain gets sick and 2nd in command gets suspended
    - New captain was horribly inexperienced and not even registered as a crew member
    - Late November, catch sight of Jamaica but misidentify it as a different island (Espanola?) and surpass Jamaica by 300 miles

- Supposedly it would taken 10-13 days to get back to Jamaica, but only 4 days of water left
    - Posed an *economic* problem
    - Owners had bought insurance for both the ship and cargo that would cover £8,000
    - Close to 60 Africans already died, and if the captain died of natural causes then no insurance would be paid out
    - Maritime law allowed cargo to be ditched in certain amounts to ensure safety of the rest
        - Insurance in this instance could pay an average of £30 per ditched cargo (in this case literal human beings)
        - In November, 54 *women and children* are thrown out of the cabin windows
        - On December 1st, 42 men are thrown out of the cabin windows. At least 10 more jumped out of defiance
    - A total of 142 human beings were killed/thrown over board
    - Arrives in Jamaica with only 208 people left
    - Sell remaining cargo for £36 per

- Insurance claim is filed, but the company refuses to pay it out
    - A lawsuit is filed
    - First trial in favor of the ship owners
        - "No more than if they were horses or other cargo" qualified the ship the insurance as dictated by maritime law
    - Second trial
        - Insurance company argues against the claim, citing poor management/incompetency (*not the murder*) and claiming there was enough water
    - None of the discussion revolved around the mass murder and loss of over 200 people
    - Maritime language/legalese obscured reality

**The Rupture**

- Slaves are no longer just slaves but commodities
- The "Administration" provides new context and language to make sense of it; the development of maritime law

## Social Death

- Social being (friends, family, identity) decimated by commodification
    - "Where are you from?" as a question to get at who a person is, via those around them
    - An unanswerable question for slave
    - Desocialization and depersonalization

Def:
> Ritualized custom of rupturing ties in both ascending (family, place of origin, ethnic group) and descending (children) order of kinship

- Key part of the alchemy of converting human to commodity

- Importantly, slaves are incorporated into their master's society but in a liminal way (almost "living" and "dead" simulatenously)
    - Continual reincorporation after being bought over and over

## Henning Statutes

- Difference betwee Native Americans and Negroes
    - Native Americans had valuable knowledge of the land
    - Were provided an "out" of slavery if they agreed to assimilate to Christianity and "knowledge of necessary trades"

# Shoah (film)

- Shoah is the Hebrew term for the Holocaust
    - Means catastrophe or destruction
- Originally commisioned by Israeli government but support was withdrawn
- Made over 5 years across 14 countries
- Used no historical footage or photography from the era of the holocaust
    - Using historical imagery deprives ones ability to imagine or
    - Prevent the consumption of historical tragedy as a spectacle
    - The presence of gaps within the testimonies forces one to fill them in themself
- Highlights the impossibility of a perfect testimony/account of the violence


## Chelmno

- Location in Poland where 400,000 Jews were exterminated
- "He's only human and wants to live, so he forgets"

- Those who said corpse or victim when digging up mass graves in the death camps were beaten
