# Susan Nathan - The Other Side of Israel

- Parallelisms in paranoia
    - Worried about safety around the Arabs
    - Colonial era worries about slave revolts
    - Modern day racial uprisings

- Difference between knowing how to navigate vs blind paranoia and fear
    - Surviving under a system: navigation through a space with barriers and systemic violence
    - Colonial navigation     : racial fantasy of impending doom and fear

- "Hospitality"
    - Is the good treatment of the colonizers a necessity for survival?
    - ... or is it rooted in religious ideals about being hospitable
