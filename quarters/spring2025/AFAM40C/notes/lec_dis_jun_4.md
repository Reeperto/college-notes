Main message of Coates

- 

## Jim Crow
- Protection of a world of white people
- Black people forced to live in the periphery and expected to follow a strict behavioral code
- Safety is an illusion, as violence can be dished out at any second
- "Separate but equal" legitimized the idea of segregation
    - Separate, but rarely ever equal
    - Redlining prevents the ability for property value to increase in black areas, meaning their public schools wouldnt get funding, leading to a viscious feedback loop that prevents any upward mobility

## Difference from Nakba/Israel
- 

## Present Absentee
- The mechanic by which Israel adminsters race
